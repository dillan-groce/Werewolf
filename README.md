Werewolf MVC

“Werewolf is a game for devious people. One minute you're a Villager, defending your theoretical home with every fiber of your being. Next, you're a Werewolf, framing your friends and accusing them of wanting to destroy your village, when really it's you who's been infiltrating it all along. Each game becomes an epic phenomenon, designed to test your personal judgment and moral character.” 
In every deck of cards comes a few wild cards. These cards can be used to add additional roles of your choice. Additional roles can have special abilities. This web MVC project will be a deployable web program where users can create wild card ideas and share them with the rest of the world. A wild card can include a photo, the role (or name), and the power they have.

Game Play:

Step 1-
Gather your players. You need at least 7 people to play.

Step 2-
Every player randomly draws a character card from the deck. You will always have a minimum of 1 Moderator, 1 Seer, 1 Doctor, and 2 Werewolves. The rest of the players should all be villagers. Add 1 Werewolf for every 4 players in the game.

Step 3-
Everybody reveals their drawn card to the moderator so they can keep track of who's who.

The game alternates between Nighttime & Daytime rounds, starting with the night.

At the beginning of the night, the Moderator tells all players to close their eyes. Everyone begins slapping their knees, the table, or clapping their hands to cover up any noises of the night.

During the night, the Moderate prompts the following characters to wake up one by one:

Werewolves:
"Werewolves, open your eyes!"
The Werewolves open their eyes and look around to find the other Werewolves in the game.
The Werewolves then hunt. The moderator says "Werewolves, choose someone to kill"
The Werewolves silently agree on which Villager they are pointing.
Werewolves sleep.

Doctor:
"Doctor, awaken. Who would you like to heal?"
The doctor can select any one player to "heal" or keep alive during the night.
This will reverse the kill of a Werewolf if chosen.
Doctor sleeps.

Seer:
"Seer, open your eyes. Who's identity would you like revealed?"
If it is a Werewolf, Moderator signals with a thumbs up.
If it is not a Werewolf, Moderate signals with a thumbs down. 
Seer sleeps.

Moderator: "Everybody open your eyes - its now daytime"

Moderator announces who was killed or saved last night.

If someone is killed, that person is immediately out of the game, and they do not reveal their character.

Introductions:
On the first day, go around and have everyone introduce themselves. For example, "Hey, I'm Matt. I'm the baker here in town, and I'm a Villager." You do not have to give away your real identity.

Discussion:
Players discuss who they think are the Werewolves. Who's telling the truth or lying to survive? Characters may choose to share or withhold information they've discovered, but but be careful, you may become a target.

Accusations:
If someone is accused, and the accusation is supported by a second player, the accused gets 30 seconds to defend themselves, and then it's put up to a vote to decide their fate.

Voting: 
After a player has had a chance to defend themselves, a vote is held to decide whether or not to kill off the player. A majority vote is needed to do so. If not, the Village discussion continues.

Time Limit?:
To keep the game moving along, you can put a time limit for reach day, and if the village doesn't chose someone to kill, they miss their opportunity. Five minutes is recommend for daytime.

Night Fall:
Once a player is voted to be killed or the time limit has expired for the Day, Night begins again. If certain characters have been killed off, they are still "woken up" in order to conceal their identities.

IN ORDER TO WIN THIS GAME -
The Villagers (all non-Werewolf cards) win & save the Village if they identify & kill all of the Werewolves.
The Werewolves win if the number of Werewolves equal the number of Villagers left.
